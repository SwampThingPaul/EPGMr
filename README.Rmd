This package is an R-version of the original Everglades Phosphorus Gradient Model developed by Walker and Kadlec and implements the model described in:

[Report](http://www.wwwalker.net/epgm/epgm_Aug_1996_1_of_2.pdf) [Appendix](http://www.wwwalker.net/epgm/epgm_Aug_1996_2_of_2.pdf).
 
The model is further described in:

## From the Original EPGM documentation developed by [Walker and Kadlec (1996)](http://www.wwwalker.net/epgm/).
### Synopsis:
Everglades Phosphorus Gradient Model (EPGM; Figure 1) predicts variations in water-column phosphorus (P) concentration, peat accretion rate, and soil P concentration along a horizontal gradient imposed by an external P load and sheet-flow conditions. Cattail densities and total areas are predicted based upon correlations with soil P and are surrogates for impacts on ecosystem components which respond to soil P variations in similar concentration ranges. The model is calibrated to soil and vegetation data from WCA-2 (primarily), WCA-1, and WCA-3A. The model successfully simulates observed [longitudinal gradients in soil P concentration below the S10 structures in WCA-2A](http://www.wwwalker.net/epgm/wca2a_gradient.htm) after ~28 years of external P loading (1962 to 1990). Observed expansion of cattail populations in this region between 1973 and 1991 is also simulated, though somewhat over-predicted during the first 20 years. Model results suggest a linear relationship between marsh water-column and soil P concentrations over long time scales. Estimated soil response times range from 20 to 40 years, depending on soil depth, and are inversely related to water-column concentration.
