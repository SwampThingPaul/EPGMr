Description: The model used for Stormwater Treatment Area (STA) design is expanded to include mass balances on marsh water-columns and surface soils. EPGM (Everglades Phosphorus Gradient Model) predicts variations in water-column P concentration, peat accretion rate, and soil P concentration along a horizontal gradient imposed by an external phosphorus load and sheet-flow conditions. Potential biological responses are expressed in terms of marsh surface area exceeding threshold criteria for water-column and soil phosphorus concentrations. More information of the model can be found at http://www.wwwalker.net/epgm/
